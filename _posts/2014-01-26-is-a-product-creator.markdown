title: "Product Creators and Efficiency"
---

I've been reading [The Year Without Pants](http://www.amazon.com/The-Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com/dp/1118660633),
_Wordpress.com and the future of work_, and came across a quote that made me feel things:

>Product creators are the true talent of any corporation, especially one claiming to bet
on innovation. The other roles don't create products and should be there to serve those
who do. A classic betrayal of this idea is when the IT department dictates to creatives
what equipment they can use. If one group has to be inefficient, it should be the support
group, not the creatives. If the supporting roles, including managment, dominate, the 
quality of products can only suffer.

I highly recommend the book; it's been a great read so far.
