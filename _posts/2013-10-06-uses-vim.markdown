title:  "Using Vim"
---

I've been a vim user for a little over a year now. I'm much faster developing now than when I worked with Sublime Text, and it's a bit like playing a musical instrument. 

Opening up a project always starts in that project's directory with

{%highlight bash%}
$ vim .
{%endhighlight%}

We're presented with a directory listing which we can navigate through with the `h j k l` keys and open up a file or enter a director by pressing `<Enter>`

I like to have three tabs open in vim:

1. All CSS files
2. JS files
3. Markup Files

This helps me focus on one task at a time, and encourages a looser coupling between the data and presentation layers.

Let's open up a few scss files by going into the scss directory and press `<Enter>` on the first file we need. I'll start with `style.scss`, which contains mostly `@import` statements and the ties the entire architecture together. 

{%highlight bash%}
" ============================================================================
../
.git/
img/
js/
scss/
.gitignore
404.html*
Gruntfile.js
README.md
favicon.ico*
humans.txt*
index.html*
package.json
{%endhighlight%}

I often keep two vertically split windows open in this tab, containing the main style.scss, and any .scss file I'm working on at some time.

To open up our `_variables.scss` file and split the window vertically, we can type 

{% highlight bash %}
  :vsp _variables.scss
{% endhighlight %}

If I'm not sure of the exact filename, but want to open up a vertical split in the current directory, which in this case is the `scss` directory, I type:

{% highlight bash %}
  :Vex
{% endhighlight %}

Sometimes I find that I need to create a new file in the same directory, so while in the file explorer window, I type `%` which allows me to enter a filename for our new addition to the buffer. The file will not be created until it's saved with a `:w`

<img src='/img/vim1.png' style='max-width:100%;'>

Next, I open up a new tab with all the JavaScript files I'm working on, which is usually a main.js file. I open the main.js file in a new tab with 

{% highlight bash %}
  :tabe js/main.js
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly, I open up a third tab with any markup-related files I'm working on. 


{% highlight bash %}
  :tabe index.html
{% endhighlight %}

<img src='/img/vim2.png' style='max-width:100%;'>

I now have three tabs open between which I can quickly jump by pressing `gt` in normal mode. This will just cycle through the tabs. If I need to go to the third tab, I can prefix the `gt` command with a count:


{% highlight bash %}
  3gt
{% endhighlight %}
