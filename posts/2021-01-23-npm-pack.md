When publishing on npm, how do you know that what you _intend_
to publish is what ends up getting published?

Worst case scenario a bad build config publishes secrets like a
`.env` file.

Given the following project:

```
$ tree -a
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â””â”€â”€ package.json

0 directories, 2 files
```

and those files' contents:

```
$ cat package.json
{
  "name": "bad-npm",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}

$ cat .env
SUPER_SECRET=true
IF_ANYONE_CAN_READ_THIS="I am in big trouble"
```

Ok let's see what npm is preparing to publish:

```
$ npm pack --dry-run
npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  bad-npm@1.0.0
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
npm notice 64B .env
npm notice 46B package.json
```

ah shit. Probably shouldn't publish that, but...

```
$ npm publish
npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  bad-npm@1.0.0
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
npm notice 64B .env
npm notice 46B package.json
```

and sure enough it's now publicly available:

"https://registry.npmjs.org/bad-npm/-/bad-npm-1.0.0.tgz"

to fix this you could ignore `.env` files but I think the safest
fix is an allow list with `files`:

```
$ cat package.json
{
  "name": "bad-npm",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "files": []
}

$ npm pack --dry-run
npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  bad-npm@1.0.0
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
npm notice 61B package.json
```

nice! Seems like npm should default to error if there are no files specified.
