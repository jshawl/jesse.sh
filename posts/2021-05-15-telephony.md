We all have to start somewhere, right? This is my new side hustle: <a href='https://www.telephony.cc'>https://www.telephony.cc</a>

I'm feeling super optimistic about starting something new, and am placing
bets on the things that are important to me. I can't remember the last time
I called a business let alone answered a phone call. I almost always prefer sms so that I have time to think about my response and/or have a papertrail for reference in case I forget (to write it down). I am building a product that
scratches my own itch and attempts to invoke the change I want to see in the world.

I want to be able to text businesses:

- without it being one of the employees' personal phone numbers
- immediately receive useful information after hours

I want to be able to give out a local number:

- so that I look like a local 
- so that I don't give my personal number out to a business

Telephony is an attempt to open up the world to sms'ing businesses.

It's worth mentioning too that Twilio will be an integral part of this
product, and that's important to me because it's a company I believe in.

They recently acquired segment and sendgrid, two companies I _also_ believe in.

I think this product has the potential to expand into a marketing platform for sms, integrating customers with CRMs and chatbots.

sms is here to stay, but companies keep reimplementing chat clients. We will always (probably?) have our sms client on our handheld devices.
