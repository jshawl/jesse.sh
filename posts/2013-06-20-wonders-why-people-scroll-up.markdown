title:  "Why do People Scroll Up?"
---

[Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/) recently redesigned their website. While reading their [blog post](http://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-is-here/), I noticed that the position of the header changes based on the user's scroll direction. <!-- more -->

When the user scrolls down, the header jumps out of the way. This gives the reader a clear view of the content. If you begin to scroll up the page, the header comes back into position and makes the assumption that we're looking for navigation-type links.

Here's a demo detailing the behavior: 

<pre class="codepen" data-height="400" data-type="result" data-href="Hfuxk" data-user="jshawl" data-safe="true"> <code> </code> <a href="http://codepen.io/jshawl/pen/Hfuxk">Check out this Pen!</a> </pre>
<script src="http://codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"> </script>  

I think this is a nice touch -  a little something extra to enhance my experience. 

Why do you scroll up?
