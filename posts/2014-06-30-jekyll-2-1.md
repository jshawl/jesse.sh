title: Jekyll 2.1.0 is out, and I'm a contributor
---

Jekyll 2.1.0 was recently released, and my name is listed 
under the contributors! <http://jekyllrb.com/news/2014/06/28/jekyll-turns-21-i-mean-2-1-0/>

It was only a [small css change](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/2429), but it's the thought
that counts, right?!
